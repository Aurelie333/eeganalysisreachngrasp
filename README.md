This analysis was conducted by a Master's student of Tilburg University (NL).

This repository contains cross-validation applications of ConvNet and SVM frameworks.
Those models are applied in the aim of the classification of IBK-based experiments (i.e., classifications of reach and grasp).
This study applied those frameworks for both movement and movement intention signals (i.e., WOI [-3 2] and [-3 0], respectively).
MAT files are available on: http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets. There is 15 EEG files in total of healthy right-handed subjects. For more information on the experiment, go to: https://lampx.tugraz.at/~bci/database/001-2020/Dataset_description.pdf.
Cross-validation was implemented over all subjects'files.
